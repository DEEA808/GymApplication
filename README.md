# GymApplication

## Description
'''
The Gym Class Management Application is designed to streamline the organization and management of gym classes. The app allows administrators and trainers to efficiently manage the scheduling and details of various gym classes while offering users a smooth experience for discovering, reserving, and participating in classes. The application also anticipates future functionality for gym members to reserve spots in their desired classes.
'''
## Core Features
'''
Gym Class Management:
 Each class will have specific details, including:
 Trainer: The assigned trainer's name and details.
 Description: A brief description of the class.
 Start and End Time: The time frame when the class will take place.
 Available Spots: The number of spots available for members to reserve.
 
User Functionality:
 View, Edit, and Delete Classes: Administrators can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the classes, providing full flexibility for managing class schedules.
 Reservation Functionality (Future Development): Once members assign themselves to the gym, they can browse available classes and reserve a spot. These reservations will be added to their personal 
 class list.
'''
## CRUD Operations
'''
Create:
  Administrators can create new gym classes by specifying the trainer, description, start and end time, and available spots.
  Persistence: Once a class is created, the operation will be persisted in the local database and synchronized with the server. All class details, including the number of spots, will be stored and 
  available across devices.
Read:
  Users and administrators can view a list of available classes with all relevant details (trainer, description, times, spots).
  Persistence: The data is fetched from the server and cached locally to ensure fast load times and offline availability.
Update:
  Administrators can edit the details of any class, such as changing the trainer, adjusting the start/end time, or increasing/decreasing available spots.
  Persistence: The edited class details are updated in the local database and synced with the server to reflect changes across the system.
Delete:
  Administrators have the ability to delete any class. Once deleted, the class and all its associated data will be removed from the system.
  Persistence: The deletion is persisted both locally and on the server, ensuring that the class no longer appears for any users.
'''
## Persistence
'''
All CRUD operations performed on gym classes are persisted locally in a database and synced with a remote server.
'''
## Offline Access Scenarios
'''
1.Create:
  When an administrator creates a new class while offline, the class details will be saved locally in the app's database with a "pending sync" status.
  Once the app is back online, the class will automatically be uploaded and synced with the server, ensuring it appears for all users.
2. Read/View:
  If users are offline while attempting to view classes, the app will fetch and display the locally cached class information.
  Cached data will allow users to view previously synced classes even without an active internet connection. Once the app reconnects to the internet, any new or updated class information will be 
  downloaded from the server.
3. Update/Edit:
  When editing a class offline, the updated information will be saved locally, and the class will be marked for "pending update."
  As soon as the device reconnects to the internet, the app will automatically sync the updated class details with the server, ensuring consistency.
4. Delete:
  When deleting a class offline, the app will remove the class from the local database but mark it as "pending deletion."
  Once the app reconnects, the deletion will be synchronized with the server, removing the class from all devices.
'''
## Future Development: Reservation System
'''
In the next phase, the app will introduce a user reservation system. Gym members will be able to:
  Browse available classes.
  Reserve spots in their desired classes (based on available spots).
  View and manage their reserved classes through their profile.
